### My Templates explained

I have added three (maybe more later) templates that I often use to create Workbooks from.  These are JSON files, import as explained here: https://github.com/CliveW-MSFT/KQLpublic/blob/master/README.md

They have a Subscription, Workspace and Time picker parameters.  They also have my Help toggle parameter, for Help details and Change Log.

1. _withHelp_ has the above features.
2. _withHelpandTabs_ builds on #1, plus it has two example Tabs (Tab One and Tab Two, which you would rename)
3. _withHelpandTabs_ builds on both the above and adds Groups to aid your workbook.  https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/platform/workbooks-groups  

I have added a small Gif file to show how you change these, for example #1 and #2.  

All you need to do is add your queries and code.

Feedback welcome
